## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository showcases a **real-time suspicious object detection** system developed using deep learning. It is capable of detecting potentially dangerous objects such as knives, guns, and human faces by leveraging powerful object detection models.

Built for integration with **CCTV surveillance systems**, this solution uses a **fusion of YOLOv8n and YOLOv8l** models to ensure higher detection accuracy with reduced false positives.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Real-time CCTV integration
- ✅ YOLOv8n and YOLOv8l model fusion
- ✅ Averaging fusion technique for improved results
- ✅ Detection of knives, guns, and faces
- ✅ Lightweight & scalable implementation
